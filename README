How to run:
./compile.sh
./run.sh SERVER_HOSTNAME LOG_FILENAME [PORT]

The client starts data transfers in passive mode by default.
Use "passive off" to disable passive mode.
Use "passive off PORTNUMBER" to disable passive mode and specify a port number.
Example: "passive off 30123" enables PORT mode on port number 30123.

Use "help" to get a list of available commands
Use "help COMMAND" to get usage information for that command.
